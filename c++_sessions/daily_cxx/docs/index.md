# Welcome!

Thanks for visiting our homepage and showing interest in Daily C++. Our
mission is to create a benign atmosphere at Bosch, where people feel happy and
comfortable to learn and to share their knowledge among colleagues.

## The format

Daily C++ is a format of presentations designed for people who need to learn a
lot of things and that do not have much time. The presentations are guided by
the following ideals:

- Every day a small training (divide and conquer)
- Every presentation 10 minutes long (fits in any schedule)
- For colleagues by colleagues (internal training and project tailored)
- All talks shall be available as videos with exercises

## Target Audience

You! Every Bosch employee shall easily find a suitable learning video
regardless of his current skill level. Also tooling setup is intended to be
easy and fun. 

## Where to start

First you need [compiler and tooling](tooling.html). Then you can visit the
[playlists](playlists.html).
